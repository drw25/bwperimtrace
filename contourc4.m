function C = contourc4(x,y,Z,v)
% Limited functionality wrapper to calculate output similar to contourc
% using nearest neighbour interpolation via bwperimtrace. Only acceptable
% input format is (x,y,Z,v) where x, y give coordinates for centre of
% pixels whose data are in 2D matrix Z, and v contains one or more contour
% values.
